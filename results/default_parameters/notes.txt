delta_v = H0 * delta_dprop (H0 * difference in proper LOS distance in Mpc)
	dprop = dcomovinglos(z,/Mpc)/(1+z) = dz/redh100()/(1+z)
	dz = comoving LOS distance in Mpc/h
mass limit for IP candidate status is John's -0.5 dex ("...dm0.5.fits")
mass limits do consider SF status (i.e. mass limit for given field and redshift is different for SF and Q galaxies)
