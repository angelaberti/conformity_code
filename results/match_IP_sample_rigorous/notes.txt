; develop rigorous high mass cutoff for matching SF and Q IP samples based on Moustakas13 stellar mass function
	single cutoff for all fields
; create matched IP samples field-by-field, applying same high mass cut (above) to each field
; get late fraction statistics using binwidth of 1 Mpc (possibly others later)
