take all IP candidates above 

matchedIPsampleFBF_PHI3.7.fits
- all matched IPs

matchedIPsampleFBF_PHI3.7_highLowQuarts.fits
- lowest and highest quartiles (SFR/M*) taken first, THEN z & mstar distributions matched
- large upweighting of highest quartile (max weight 17 among all fields)
	- degree of upweighting can be controlled by decreasing z and mstar bin size

matchedIPsampleFBF.fits
- z & mstar matching done first, then lowest & highest SFR/M* quartiles taken
- further sample narrowing to rematch z distributions (median M* different by ~0.02 dex)
